# Airbnb Clone

## Deployed Application:

Heroku: https://backend-project-airbnb.herokuapp.com/

## Description

This project is a clone of Airbnb. Users can host their own rooms, as well as view other users hosted rooms.
Users can also see the reviews other people have left on their possible vacation spots, and leave their own reviews on rooms they have previously stayed at.

In the future, the ability to create bookings and upload images for reviews and rooms will be implemented
